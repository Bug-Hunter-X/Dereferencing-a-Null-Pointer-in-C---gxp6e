This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer.  The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to write a value to a memory location that hasn't been allocated. This results in undefined behavior, often a program crash. The solution (`bugSolution.cpp`) shows how to avoid this error by checking for null pointers before dereferencing them.
